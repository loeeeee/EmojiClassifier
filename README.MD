# Emoji Classifier

## Intro

> This is a course project for STATS 302. We want to classify the pictures of emoji from different companies. The project goal is sample. We want to create a model that could tell which company does the given emoji picture belongs to. The thing is that the emoji is picture represented by the UTF-8, and different devices from different companies would render them in a different manner. You could tell one emoji is from Apple, and another one is from Samsung by looking at their styles.

## Quick start

> Run settings.py. It will create necessary config and data folder for you.
